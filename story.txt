Once upon a time, there was a brilliant inventor named Alex Jestewo. He had recently invented a new method of
instant communication called the octo telegram. It was going to take the world by storm. 

Everyone had heard of the telegram, but due to its large size and slow speeds, it was very difficult to use. The octo telegram is eight times as small, and was able to send communicate within 8 milliseconds. It took years of improving on microtechnology to make an invention as technically advanced and important as this. He dedicated his whole life to this project after realizing it was a possibility.
