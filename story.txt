Once upon a time, there was a brilliant inventor named Alex Jestewo. He had recently invented a new method of
instant communication called the octo telegram. It was going to take the world by storm. 

Everyone had heard of the telegram, but due to its large size and slow speeds, it was very difficult to use. The octo telegram is eight times as small, and was able to send communicate within 8 milliseconds. It took years of improving on microtechnology to make an invention as technically advanced and important as this. He dedicated his whole life to this project after realizing it was a possibility.

When he decided to show his new invention to the world that night, He saw something in the newspaper 
that he couldn't even believe. It said that someone new inventor already
had introduced exact the same thing as he did yesterday!

Furious, Alex ran to the nearest law firm as quick as possible. Fuming, Alex explained his situation to the desk clerk and she told him to wait there and
that someone would be with him shortly. While he sat waiting Alex thought to himself "How could this happen? Why me?" Finally, a lawyer approached Alex.
The lawyer told Alex that since he hadn't pattened the octo telegram there was nothing he could do to help poor Alex.

Alex then found the other inventor and ended him, taking all the credit for the invention. Go Alex. The end
